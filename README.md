## Archaeal_extracellular_vesicles

The following data for the publication "Proteomic and metabolomic profiling of extracellular vesicles produced by human gut archaea" are made public:
Folders contain R scripts and data tables for mentioned figures.

- Cell_viabilit_plots = Supplementary Figure S6
- Co_incubations = Figure 6: Heat map showing the induction of cytokine release by macrophages (differentiated THP-1 cells), and intestinal epithelial cells (HT-29).
- Metabolomics = Figure 4: Metabolites detected in archaeal vesicles.
- Proteomics = Figure 3: Mass spectrometry-based profiling of AEV proteomes. (c) Bar chart displaying mean intensities/relative abundances of protein categories in AEVs and WCLs based on proteins detected in all three biological replicates of both M. smithii ALI and M. intestini (n=229). and (d) Heatmap showing enrichment of 46 proteins annotated as adhesin/adhesion/IG-like present in all six AEV extracts (three biological replicates each of AEV M. smithii ALI and AEV M. intestini) compared to the whole cell lysates based on relative abundances.
- Vesicle properties = Figure 2: Vesicle properties of M. smithii ALI, M. intestini, M. smithii GRAZ-2, and M. stadtmanae.
